    // Can be bound to a single `Connection` or `ConnectionList` (the type of which has to be symmetric to this one, see the comment on `Bind`).
    // When bound, stores a pointer to the remote connection and to its owner (the enclosing class, possibly indirectly enclosing),
    //   and some type-erased callbacks that are called automatically in certain situations.
    // If `LocalStateT` is specified, also stores a value of that type, which can be freely accessed.
    // When const, it can't be bound/unbound, the user state becomes const, and the remote connection will be exposed only as const. Everything else shouldn't change.
    // NOTE: This class can be moved, but if it's connected, it will look for a new owner at the same offset relative to itself, be careful.
